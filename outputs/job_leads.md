### Fit Summary
This internship is a strong fit for Estelle due to her extensive Python proficiency, strong data analysis and programming skills, and her preference for remote work and current location in Spain. While titled 'Prácticas FP,' her comprehensive university coursework and practical skills align well with the technical requirements of a Python-focused intern role, despite the academic designation difference.

### Key Gaps
- The 'Prácticas FP' designation typically refers to vocational training internships, which might technically differ from a university bachelor's program. Estelle should clarify if her university program is eligible for this type of internship.
- The job posting is very generic, making it difficult to assess fit for specific advanced Python applications Estelle has studied (e.g., particular ML frameworks, specific Big Data tools beyond PySpark basic knowledge).

### CV Tips

### Fit Summary
Estelle possesses a robust analytical and computational background highly transferable to engineering support roles, including strong programming skills in Python and R, and experience with simulation and data analysis. However, her direct academic background in Electrical Engineering is limited, which presents a domain-specific knowledge gap for a core 'Electrical Systems' role.

### Key Gaps
- Lack of specific academic coursework or practical experience in core Electrical Engineering concepts (e.g., circuits, power systems, control theory).
- No explicit experience with electrical engineering-specific software tools or hardware.
- Limited direct industry experience in the energy, utilities, or heavy manufacturing sectors.

### CV Tips
- Reframe coursework in 'Operating Systems and Parallel Computing', 'Simulating and Modeling to Understand Change', and 'Advanced Data Structures and Storage' to emphasize systems-level thinking and large-scale data handling relevant to complex engineering projects.
- Explicitly highlight proficiency in Python and R for scientific computing, data analysis, and simulation, positioning these as valuable tools for an engineering team.
- In the 'Education' section, consider adding a brief bullet point under 'relevant coursework' stating an eagerness to apply strong analytical foundations to new engineering domains, specifically mentioning an interest in energy systems.
- Showcase soft skills like problem-solving, project coordination, and adaptability from the Ardazaei experience, emphasizing the ability to quickly grasp and contribute to technical challenges, even if in a different domain.
- If any personal projects or academic assignments involved data from physical systems (even if not electrical), highlight them to demonstrate a tangible connection to real-world data application.

### Cover Letter
Dear Westinghouse Electric Company Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Electrical Systems Engineering Intern position at your San Sebastián de los Reyes office, as advertised on LinkedIn. As a second-year Bachelor of Science in Data and Business Analytics student at IE University, currently based in Madrid, I am actively seeking a challenging summer internship for June-August 2026 where I can apply my robust analytical, computational, and problem-solving skills to real-world engineering challenges within a globally significant industry like yours.

While my primary degree focuses on data, my extensive coursework in advanced mathematics (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability & Statistics), programming (Python, R, PySpark), and systems-level concepts (Operating Systems, Parallel Computing, Algorithms & Data Structures) has equipped me with a powerful analytical toolkit. I am proficient in data modeling, simulation, and visualization, which I believe are invaluable assets for supporting complex electrical systems projects. My experience in 'Simulating and Modeling to Understand Change' and 'Programming for Data Management and Analysis' underscores my ability to contribute to data-driven insights and process optimization within an engineering context, despite not having a direct electrical engineering background.

I am a highly motivated and adaptable individual, demonstrated by my academic achievements, leadership roles, and experience at Ardazaei AB where I contributed to technical solutions and coordinated complex international logistics. My entrepreneurial mindset and strong desire to learn new technical domains would allow me to quickly integrate and contribute to your team. I am eager to leverage my quantitative skills to support Westinghouse's critical mission and deepen my understanding of electrical systems engineering from industry leaders. Thank you for considering my application; I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.

## 5/10 — Bertrandt Web Solutions - Internship at Bertrandt Group

**Location:** Getafe, Community of Madrid, Spain (On-site)  
**Link:** https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4320250393/?eBP=NOT_ELIGIBLE_FOR_CHARGING&refId=rIFT2oH4OsI%2FZV4uhrNZDQ%3D%3D&trackingId=Fx0GmqmQvdM5Dpeb9OodIg%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_jobs_discovery_jymbii  

### Fit Summary
While Estelle possesses strong foundational programming (Python, SQL), data structures, and analytical skills relevant to many tech roles, her profile's primary focus is on data science and analytics. The 'Web Solutions' internship title suggests a stronger emphasis on web development frameworks and technologies (frontend/backend) where her direct experience and listed skills are less prominent, making it a moderate but not ideal fit.

### Key Gaps
- Specific experience with modern web development frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask, React, Angular, Vue.js)
- Extensive experience with HTML, CSS, and advanced JavaScript
- Portfolio of web development projects showcasing frontend or backend capabilities

### CV Tips
- Reframe your Python skills to highlight capabilities most relevant to web development, such as OOP, GUI programming, and web scraping, indicating an ability to build functional applications.
- Emphasize your strong understanding of algorithms, data structures, and database management (SQL, NoSQL), which are critical for efficient web solution development.
- If you have any personal projects, even small ones, that involve web components (e.g., a simple API, a basic webpage with JavaScript interaction), add them to showcase web-related initiative.
- In the 'technical solution development' point for Ardazaei, expand on the technical aspects and problem-solving involved, linking it to practical solution implementation.

## 1/10 — Videogame Tester - Russian at Electronic Arts (EA)

**Location:** Madrid, Community of Madrid, Spain (Hybrid)  
**Link:** https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4363218858/?eBP=CwEAAAGclcvkdF_bDWhYYxmjsUCawAAKreyrMqKnou0Ebl6AjQFLBaTHGxSoq5bOoPSbnZ7ytCWR9obb0jhD4ZdE1goHaFlzC69EpqWw3oRiRrJkNX8iAdNvbYtThRcG6jvn12mrTMp6y3CjBwQgHfRCVMk1dGjhYSZokg7d_m5FZ8pqu5_2g_Shp6DSp30oMseu5OIAvv_bRCIjElK8ePOc1Y1RJ6veRNiXur3PvGcfheL1QGuI49MvONfR3z6yJJdjYkLI_TTJ_QKKrsYCaOWVj3K7ir18hDACoN7slN7KoyXzK0CdWHxTC6f7QYlibM4Sk-BrQufNNcoNWIEEqU9jy8sRVhs1Fd6o22P4iMM9wQbneRwH0CplJPRo68-3RZQB6pULJ1ydEd3Yk5-NLev4f73kZvgGobN-O6Rs2OFB9GcW6Moic3Cj39wh4IZKoqc-rR5xd6QkcKsU5w8Nj0-RnxrhyZ6eFYkB_bekUwcDn0vdOfYc8uwgPo35SPbmrgb1l4qZAe4YEYSX&refId=%2BMU9%2BF1k30MXCE89zUm9hQ%3D%3D&trackingId=JFb3jvo6Pz59kBSM9FGWCQ%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_jobs_discovery_jymbii  

### Fit Summary
This role is a poor fit primarily due to the explicit language requirement (Russian, which Estelle does not speak) and the specialized nature of videogame testing, which does not align with her advanced Data and Business Analytics skillset and career aspirations. While it is a junior role in Madrid, the core requirements are entirely mismatched.

### Key Gaps
- Proficiency in the Russian language is a direct requirement for this specific role and is not present in Estelle's profile.
- Lack of demonstrated interest or experience in quality assurance (QA) or video game testing, which is distinct from her data science and business analytics focus.
- Her advanced technical skills (ML, Big Data, complex analytics) are largely irrelevant to a standard videogame tester position.

### CV Tips
- This job is highly specialized by language and industry; it is not recommended to tailor a CV for this role as the core language requirement is unmet. Instead, focus on roles that align with her Data & Business Analytics skills.
- If hypothetically applying despite the mismatch, highlight transferable soft skills like attention to detail, problem-solving, and critical thinking, as well as her strong academic performance which demonstrates an ability to learn complex systems quickly.
- Any personal interest in gaming (if applicable, though not listed) would need to be explicitly added and emphasized to show some connection to the industry.
